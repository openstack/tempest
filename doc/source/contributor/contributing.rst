So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Tempest.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* IRC channel ``#openstack-qa`` at FreeNode
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[qa]`` for faster responses)
  http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss

Contacting the Core Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to the `Tempest Core Team
<https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/42,members>`_ contacts.

New Feature Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to propose a new feature please read `Feature Proposal Process`_
Tempest features are tracked on `Launchpad BP <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tempest>`_.

Task Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We track our tasks in `Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tempest>`_.

If you're looking for some smaller, easier work item to pick up and get started
on, search for the 'low-hanging-fruit' tag.

Reporting a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You found an issue and want to make sure we are aware of it? You can do so on
`Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tempest/+filebug>`__.
More info about Launchpad usage can be found on `OpenStack docs page
<https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/task-tracking.html#launchpad>`_

Getting Your Patch Merged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All changes proposed to the Tempest require two ``Code-Review +2`` votes from
Tempest core reviewers before one of the core reviewers can approve the patch by
giving ``Workflow +1`` vote. More detailed guidelines for reviewers are available
at :doc:`../REVIEWING`.

Project Team Lead Duties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All common PTL duties are enumerated in the `PTL guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/ptl.html>`_.
