      Base Tempest job.

      This Tempest job provides the base for both the single and multi-node
      test setup. To run a multi-node test inherit from devstack-tempest and
      set the nodeset to a multi-node one.

      Base Tempest IPv6 job. This job is derived from 'devstack-ipv6'
      which set the IPv6-only setting for OpenStack services. As part of
      run phase, this job will verify the IPv6 setting and check the services
      endpoints and listen addresses are IPv6. Basically it will run the script
      ./tool/verify-ipv6-only-deployments.sh

      Child jobs of this job can run their own set of tests and can
      add post-run playebooks to extend the IPv6 verification specific
      to their deployed services.
