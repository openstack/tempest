prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Tempest for OpenStack Stein release.
    This release marks the start of Stein release support in Tempest and
    the end of support for Ocata in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Stein
    * Rocky
    * Queens
    * Pike

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Train development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Train cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Train (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Stein release.
