    The CLIClient class, when it calls a command line client, uses
    --os-project-name instead of --os-tenant-name for the project, and
    passes --os-identity-api-version (default empty).
    All CLI clients still available in supported releases of OpenStack
    which are wrapped by the cmd_with_auth() method support those
    switches.
