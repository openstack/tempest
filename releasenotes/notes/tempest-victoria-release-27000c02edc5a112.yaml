prelude: |
    This release is to tag the Tempest for OpenStack Victoria release.
    This release marks the start of Victoria release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Victoria
    * Ussuri
    * Train
    * Stein

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Wallaby development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Wallaby cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Victoria (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Victoria release.
