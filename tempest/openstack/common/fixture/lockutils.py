    """External locking fixture.

    This fixture is basically an alternative to the synchronized decorator with
    the external flag so that tearDowns and addCleanups will be included in
    the lock context for locking between tests. The fixture is recommended to
    be the first line in a test method, like so::

        def test_method(self):
            self.useFixture(LockFixture)
                ...

    or the first line in setUp if all the test methods in the class are
    required to be serialized. Something like::

        class TestCase(testtools.testcase):
            def setUp(self):
                self.useFixture(LockFixture)
                super(TestCase, self).setUp()
                    ...

    This is because addCleanups are put on a LIFO queue that gets run after the
    test method exits. (either by completing or raising an exception)
    """
