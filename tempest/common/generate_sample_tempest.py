# NOTE(mtreinish): This hack is needed because of how oslo config is used in
# tempest. Tempest is run from inside a test runner and so we can't rely on the
# global CONF object being fully populated when we run a test. (test runners
# don't init every file for running a test) So to get around that we manually
# load the config file in tempest for each test class to ensure that every
# config option is set. However, the tool expects the CONF object to be fully
# populated when it inits all the files in the project. This just works around
# the issue by manually loading the config file (which may or may not exist)
# which will populate all the options before running the generator.
